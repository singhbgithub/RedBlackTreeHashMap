RedBlackTreeHashMap
===================


This was an assignment for my Object-Oriented Design course. The BenchFMap and TestFMap were provided by professors 
Clinger and Schmidt of CCIS at NEU. TestFMap was modified to include more test cases. This assignment showed the
difference implementation made in time complexity (my red black tree implementation was no match for the built in java 
implementations).
